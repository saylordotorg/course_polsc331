In this course, you will learn about the complexities of the legislative
branch by examning the U.S. Congress in the American political system.
 Course content will focus first on the history of Congress and the
constant tension between Congress’ competing representation and
lawmaking functions.  In this respect, you will focus on topics that
include the history and original purpose of the legislative branch, the
basic structure of Congress, and the electoral considerations and
dynamics that impact how members of Congress act.  The course will then
take a careful look at the internal politics and law-making processes of
Congress.  Here, you will learn not only the “nuts and bolts” of the
legislative process, but also the reasons why rules are designed as they
are as well as the external competing interests that impact members and
shape legislative outcomes.  By the end of the course, you should be
able to explain how a bill becomes a law, how it evolved throughout the
legislative process, and what internal and external factors impacted it
along the way.  This course will enable you to have a deeper
understanding of Congress and the entire legislative process in American
politics.

 **Primary Resources: ** This course is comprised of a range of
different free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use
of the following materials:

 -          [Congressional Research Service
Reports](http://www.llrx.com/features/crsreports.htm)  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Although all of the units will allow you to gain a foundational
understanding of Congress, pay close attention to Unit 1, as it will lay
the historical framework for future units.  You will also need to
complete:  
    
             - Sub-subunit 1.1.3 Assignment  
             - Sub-subunit 2.3.3 Assignment  
             - Sub-subunit 3.3.1 Assignment  
             - The Final Exam  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments listed above.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  
  
  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it. 
If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **86
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 14.75 hours to complete. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
sub-subunits 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night;
sub-subunit 1.1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.2 (a
total of 4.75 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.

prerequisite to help prepare you for the material covered.  The course
is important, however, to help prepare you for future upper level
courses in the political science discipline, so be sure to pay close
attention to all course material.  To help make the most of your
learning experience, please read all the materials and watch the videos
