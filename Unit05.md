**Unit 5: Congress and Policy-Making** <span id="5"></span> 
*This final unit brings together many of the concepts from earlier in
the semester and explores how Congress makes domestic and foreign
policy. * *Public policy refers to the actions taken by
government—decisions that are intended to solve problems and improve the
quality of life for its citizens.  At the federal level, public policies
are enacted to regulate industry and business, to protect citizens at
home and abroad, to aid state and city governments and people such as
the poor through funding programs, and to encourage social goals.  The
first half of the unit will concentrate on domestic policy-making as
well as the history and evolution of the federal budget and various
social programs.  In the second half of the unit, you will learn more
about the role that Congress plays in the creation and implementation of
international and defense policy.  Finally, we examine the future of
Congress and the internal changes being considered in light of various
scandals and other corruptive activities that have weakened the
institution.  *
