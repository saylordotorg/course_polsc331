**Unit 2: Becoming a Member of Congress** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will explore the process of becoming a member of
Congress and the responsibilities of members once they are elected.  The
first subunit will focus on the recruitment of candidates and the role
of political parties and other elected officials in grooming and
persuading strong candidates to run.  In the second subunit, you will
learn more about the actual election process, the critical importance of
money, and how redistricting can play a major role in congressional
electoral outcomes.  Finally, the unit will take a look at the actions
of members both in their home congressional districts and in

their actions are designed to ensure their future re-election.  In this
unit, you will also focus on the roles and duties of members of
Congress.*
