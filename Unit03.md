**Unit 3: Congressional Organization** <span id="3"></span> 
*In the previous units, you learned about the history of Congress and
the actions of its individual members.  In this unit, you will begin to
look more closely at Congress as an institution.  You will also begin to
discover the true complexities of “how a bill becomes a law.”  The first
subunit will focus on the importance of party leadership, especially in
the House of Representatives, and its influence on cohesion within the
rank-and-file, congressional actions and outcomes.  You will then learn
about the role that committees play in Congress and will take a look at
how committees have become more important over time, in addition to
study groups and task forces which are often created out of public
policy necessity.  The third subunit will shed light on some of the
(often controversial) rules and procedures of the House and the Senate
and discuss the ways in which these rules shape legislation.  By the end
of the unit you will learn how the internal organization and rules of
Congress create a dynamic and complex legislative process. *
