**Unit 4: Congress and Inter-Institutional Dynamics** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In the American political system, no individual branch of government
holds supreme power.  Although the founders may have wanted the
legislative branch to wield the most power, the Constitution’s system of
checks-and-balances and its separation of powers prohibit Congress from
solely controlling the government.  Congress must work with other
political actors in order to propose, promote, and implement
legislation. This often involves significant bargaining, compromising,
and negotiating with each other.  This unit will explore the
relationship that Congress has with the other major players in American
politics—the President, the bureaucracy, the courts, and the media. 
Each of these entities plays a major role in influencing congressional
action in some way.  After completing this unit, you will have a keen
understanding of how Congress interacts with other political players in
the American political system.  *
